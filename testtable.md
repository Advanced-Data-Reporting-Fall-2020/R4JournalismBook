I covered a lot of different tasks and tips in [Practical R for Mass Communication and Journalism](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-R-for-Mass-Communication-and-Journalism/Machlis/p/book/9781138726918). You can search the table below to see most of them, as well as the chapter where they appeared. (If you haven't yet bought the book, you can [purchase it from publisher CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-R-for-Mass-Communication-and-Journalism/Machlis/p/book/9781138726918) or [Amazon].)

Bonus: Most of the listings include code samples!
