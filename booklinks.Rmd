The [dataMaid](https://github.com/ekstroem/dataMaid) package was designed to generate a printable PDF report for a data set. The report includes a statistical summary of a data frame by default, but it's also possible to add information such as where the data came from. Just be warned that generating PDFs within R can be complicated to set up, especially on Windows, requiring versions of TeX/LaTeX and pandoc to be on your local system. dataMaid's visualize() function doesn't require PDF-creating capabilities, though.

**RStudio's ggplot2 cheat sheet.** Download the 2-page PDF at [https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf).
	
**Computerworld's searchable, sortable table of ggplot2 commands.** I wrote this to make it searchable by task instead of command. Find it at [http://cwrld.us/ggplot2ChtSht](http://cwrld.us/ggplot2ChtSht) (there's also a link to some downloadable code snippets).

**R Graph Catalog.** A searchable catalog of different ggplot2 visualistions with downloadable sample code, maintained in part by RStudio's Jenny Bryan. [http://shinyapps.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/](http://shinyapps.stat.ubc.ca/r-graph-catalog/). Another option is **Top 50 ggplot2 Visualistions -- The Master List (With Full R Code).** And while these aren't actually _my_ top 50, you'll find some more samples with R code to browse. From r-statistics.co. [http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html](http://r-statistics.co/Top50-Ggplot2-Visualizations-MasterList-R-Code.html).

**ggplot2 graphics companion** Some very nice examples of publication-quality visualizations by type, all with code. From Trafford Data Lab in Trafford, Greater Manchester, UK. [http://www.trafforddatalab.io/graphics_companion/](http://www.trafforddatalab.io/graphics_companion/)

**Base R graphics.** Statistician and author Nathan Yau leans toward base R graphics. He did a comparison of base vs. ggplot2 for a number of data visualizations. Although written in March 2016, it should still be relevant: [https://flowingdata.com/2016/03/22/comparing-ggplot2-and-r-base-graphics/](https://flowingdata.com/2016/03/22/comparing-ggplot2-and-r-base-graphics/).

**Base R vs. ggplot2.** Two advanced R users talk about their respective viewpoints on why base R or ggplot2 is preferable. Maybe you'll be moved by one of their posts. See Why I don't use ggplot2 by Jeff Leek at Johns Hopkins University [http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/](http://simplystatistics.org/2016/02/11/why-i-dont-use-ggplot2/) and Why I use ggplot by Stack Overflow data scientist David Robinson at [http://varianceexplained.org/r/why-I-use-ggplot2/](http://varianceexplained.org/r/why-I-use-ggplot2/).

**Formula-based version of ggplot2.** If you like ggplot2's capabilities but find the syntax uncomfortable, the ggformula package on CRAN might be worth exploring. As the package vignette explains, it uses the syntax `gf_plottype(formula, data = mydataframe)`.  gf_plottype options are gf_point(), gf_line(), gf_bar(), gf_boxplot(), etc.; while the formula can be something like `yvaluecol ~ xvaluecol`. Install, load, and read the package vignette `vignette("ggformula",package = "ggformula")`.
