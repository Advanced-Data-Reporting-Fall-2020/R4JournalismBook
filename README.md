## Practical R for Mass Communications and Journalism

Welcome to the GitHub repo for my forthcoming book, Practical R for Mass Communications and Journalism. It's expected out later this year as part of the Chapman & Hall/CRC "R Series" titles. 

If you'd like to be notified when the book publishes, please sign up for my email list (which will only be used for purposes of book updates) at [http://bit.ly/R4JournosBook](http://bit.ly/R4JournosBook).

This repo includes companion data files for the book, as well as a booklinks.html file with links to additional data and resources. After publication, any needed updates or errata will be posted here as well.

Thanks for your interest!
