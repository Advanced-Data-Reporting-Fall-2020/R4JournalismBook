I covered a lot of different tasks and tips in [Practical R for Mass Communication and Journalism](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-R-for-Mass-Communication-and-Journalism/Machlis/p/book/9781138726918). You can search the table below to see most of them, as well as the chapter where they appeared. (If you haven't yet bought the book, you can [purchase it from publisher CRC Press](https://www.crcpress.com/Practical-R-for-Mass-Communication-and-Journalism/Machlis/p/book/9781138726918) or [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Practical-Mass-Communication-Journalism-Chapman/dp/1138726915/).)

Bonus: Most of the listings include code samples!


```{r echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

mytabledata <- readxl::read_xlsx("../../BookMarkdown/HowDoI.xlsx") 
mytabledata <- dplyr::arrange(mytabledata, Task)
pacman::p_load(DT)
mytable <- DT::datatable(mytabledata, rownames = FALSE, options = list(
pageLength = 50,
  lengthMenu = c(50, 100, 200)
)
)

mytable
```
